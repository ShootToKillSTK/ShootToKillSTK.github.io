Creation Process:
- The game is made entirly on a flat plain and the gravity is simulated by using a constant force
- The drop target was debugged a lot so it was able to drop from front or back depending on being hit on front/back, unreal didn't like how fast it can move and needed lots of testing and debugging solutions
