Based on the mobile game Plants vs Zombies
- Random variable enemy spawn system with increasing frequency
- Multiple plant support with ease to add more
- Rain system, skill based with faster rain spawns giving more rain (Rain is for placing plants to defend)
- Using AI art and self drawn for lots of the assets like; plants, tiles, skeletons. Edited in photoshop.
